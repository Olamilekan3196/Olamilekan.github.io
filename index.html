            <h2><pre>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wants to see his Manchester United 
                players get their sparkle back after a frustrating run of results lately.
                    The Reds kick-off our Europa League campaign on
                     Thursday night against Real Sociedad, with the match 
                    being played at the Allianz Stadium in Turin due to COVID restrictions in Spain.
                    While United have booked a spot in the Emirates
                     FA Cup quarter-finals, league form has been disappointing of late with more draws than wins.
                    
                    Ole spoke to club media's Mark Sullivan before the game
                     and discussed why he's brought a couple of 
                     youngsters on the trip, his memories of playing in Turin
                      and his hopes for his team this evening...
                    Firstly Ole, can you give us an update on the latest team news for the squad?
                    “There are a couple of doubts – Anthony [Martial]
                     and Scott [McTominay] – but they’ll travel with us.
                    Donny [van de Beek] had to come off [from training on Wednesday]
                    and Edinson [Cavani] won’t be travelling, neither will Paul [Pogba].
                    That’s it as well as Phil [Jones] who is still not fit.</h2>
