    <h1>LATEST GOVERNMENT UPDATE ON THE RETURN OF FANS</h1>
    <center>
    <p style="font-size: 1.5em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">From that key date of 17 May, if restrictions<br/>
         can still be eased, up to 10,000 people may be<br/>able to attend games or stadia could be a quarter-full, whichever figure<br/> is lower.
        “Turnstiles of our sports stadia<br/> will once again rotate, subject, in all cases, to capacity<br/> limits depending on the size of the venue,” said Johnson.<br/> “We will pilot larger events using enhanced testing with the<br/> ambition of further easing of restrictions in the next step.”</p>
